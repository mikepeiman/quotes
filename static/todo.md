# For Metabrain landing page
- try passing element dimensions and positions from index.svelte down to MetabrainCanvas as props, to be used in the canvas animation, having the lines fade out when passing through/under any of the text elements. This might make a cool looking effect, and should help make the page look cleaner and more readable. 
- add signup/login auth via Supabase
- make a page to add & view todos via dgraph database, graphql queries and mutations
