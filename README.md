# MetaBrain

## One app to rule them all. One knowledge graph for a lifetime.

Many years in conception, something is being born here...

First landing page deployed in 2015 at (the inactive) [LifewardLabs](www.lifewardlabs.com). That operating name was to encompass several projects, of which MetaBrain (then to be called LifeOS or LifeIQ - the concept of an operating system for life, and intelligence for life) was but one.

The aim is simple yet audacious: to make the best knowledge-management tool in the world. This encompasses task & project management, research & learning management platform, "quantified self" tracking, media curation of all kinds (local files, online playlists, browser windows and tabs). And more.

Several examples of the tools I want to integrate and transcend: Evernote, Notion, TODOist, Pivotal Tracker, tabs managers, playlist apps, workout apps, academic research apps, learning management platforms, and more.

Not all of this will arrive immediately, of course. The first MVP will be a minimal tracking input interface for notes and items. Tracking web browsing will be a nearterm priority. Other features will follow.

Eventually this app will form the nucleus of several projects, where you can choose to share your data to support open science/citizen science, and public conversations/arguments. 

I still have several ambitious projects in slow development. Learn more at [my IndieHackers profile](https://www.indiehackers.com/mountaindad), or my (developer blog)[https://www.mikepeiman.dev/].
